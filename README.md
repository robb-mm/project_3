## Analysis of NOAA climate change data
To analyze warming temperatures in the United States, we used the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Divisional Database (nClimDiv) and Gridded 5km GHCN-Daily Temperature and Precipitation Dataset (nClimGrid) data sets, which provide monthly temperature data between 1895 and 2019 for the Lower 48 states. We created the annual mean temperature trend charts for each state and county in the Lower 48, analyzing both annual average temperatures and temperature changes for each season (Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall).

How To Use
1) Download the files to your chosen local folder.
2) Go to your local folder, type: cd templates
3) Run the http server, type: python -m http.server
4) Open a browser, put in address bar: http://localhost:8000
5) Scroll down a little, to see the three visualization links.
  a) Temperature Change Per Season;
  b) Temperature Change 1895-2019, 
        a data visualization that shows a US map divided by counties,
        click a county to see its temperature change from 1895-2019;
  c) Temperature Average Per Year,
        a data visualization that shows only the State and County droplists,
        select an item from the droplists to see the temperature average per year.
